If "Cueing Disallowed" is shown in the Cue Band, two things might be happening:

1. You are in trial study, and you are in a phase of the study where you cannot use cueing on the Cue Band.

2. Your cueing is set to happen on your phone. To set your cueing to happen in Cue Band: 
    1. In the Cue Band app, go to the "Settings".
    2. On the "Cueing Method:" section, select "Cue Band"
