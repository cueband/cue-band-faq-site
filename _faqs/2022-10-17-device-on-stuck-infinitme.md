title: Cue Band stuck on InfiniTime screen
---

If your Cue Band device displays "InfiniTime" on its screens do the following steps:

1) Reset your Cue Band by pressing and holding the physical button on the side of the device until the screen blinks, and release the button.

2) Now on the Cue Band App, on your phone, in the main page tap "Add Device".

3) Wait for a device called "InfiniTime" to appear on the screen and tap it to associate it with your app.

If the device does not appear in the list, please retry this process a couple more times.
If still does nor work, please contact us at [support@cue.band](mailto:support@cue.band)
